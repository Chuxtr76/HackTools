## Common
## In-Band
### Summary
Output of both the intended and new query are output directly to the screen and can be directly read.
### Union Based
### Error Based
## Blind
### Summary
Output may not printed, so we'll have to use SQL logic to get the output character by character
### Boolean Based
### Time Based
## Out-of-band
### Summary
No direct access to the output, so we have to direct the output to a remote location, like a DNS record, and retrieve it from there.
